### Hi there, I'm David :wave:

Here is a little bit about me!

- :scroll: My master's thesis, [Session Kotlin](https://github.com/sessionkotlin/sessionkotlin),  is centered on implementing Multiparty Session Types in Kotlin as an Embedded Domain-Specific Language

- :seedling: Co-developed a full-stack application at NOVA-SST for managing test surveillance, currently used by the computer science department

- :heart: Automation, Cloud and anything Kotlin related
